# World Weather Analysis

## Overview

2,000 random locations were selected, each location determined by a random selection of latitudes and longitudes. From those 2,000 locations, the nearest city for each location was revealed, if applicable. The Weather API was used to get information regarding several weather characteristics for each city, transforming into a data frame. Using APIs from Google and user input for minimum and maximum temperatures (in Fahrenheit), in this case 60 and 80 respectively, cities were filtered to meet the criteria, along with them being able to accommodate for visitors, via hotel. Finally, as long as there were four eligible cities within a relatively near distance, an itenerary was created to suggested a travel plan.
